# Smooth Beta
**Version: Beta 1.7.3 (Base Edit)**

[Smooth Beta](https://github.com/mineLdiver/SmoothBeta) is a mod created by mineLdiver that makes the game use a more modern approach to graphics, leading to doubled framerate. This is a base edit version of the mod that can simply be added to a Beta 1.7.3 client jar without a mod loader. **However, [fastutil core 8.5.12](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/it/unimi/dsi/fastutil-core/8.5.12/fastutil-core-8.5.12.jar) needs to be added to the jar as it is a dependency.**
