# Staggo's Minor Minecraft Tweaks

This is a collection of mods for a wide range of versions that make minor tweaks, usually limited to one class edit.

Here are the available mods:
- [Smooth Beta Base Edit](./misc/smoothbeta.md)
- [Multiplayer Mob Jitter Fix](./mpjf/)
- [Multiplayer IP Hider](./mpih/)

## Installation
First, pick a zip for your respective version. Then drag the class file inside the zip into the version jar and delete META-INF if you haven't already. If you are using MultiMC or PrismLauncher, you can use "Add to Minecraft.jar". It's as simple as that!
